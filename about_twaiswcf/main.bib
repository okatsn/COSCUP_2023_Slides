  abstract = {Feature selection is a valuable technique in data analysis for information-preserving data reduction. This paper describes Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Multivariate Regression Trees (MRT)-based approaches for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. The well-known CART method allows to perform supervised feature selection by modeling one response variable (y) by some explanatory variables (x). The recently proposed CART extension, MRT can handle more than one response variable (y). This allows to perform a supervised feature selection in the presence of more than one response variable. For unsupervised feature selection, where no response variables are available, we propose Auto-Associative Multivariate Regression Trees (AAMRT) where the original variables (x) are not only used as explanatory variables (x), but also as response variables (y=x). Since (AA)MRT is grouping the objects into groups with similar response values by using explanatory variables, this means that the variables are found which are most responsible for the cluster structure in the data. We will demonstrate how these approaches can improve (the detection of) the cluster structure in data and how they can be used for knowledge discovery.},

  abstract   = {ABSTRACT: Herein, a recently developed methodology, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), is presented and applied to the challenge of soil moisture prediction. Support Vector Machines are derived from statistical learning theory and can be used to predict a quantity forward in time based on training that uses past data, hence providing a statistically sound approach to solving inverse problems. The principal strength of SVMs lies in the fact that they employ Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) instead of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). The SVMs formulate a quadratic optimization problem that ensures a global optimum, which makes them superior to traditional learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The resulting model is sparse and not characterized by the ``curse of dimensionality.'' Soil moisture distribution and variation is helpful in predicting and understanding various hydrologic processes, including weather changes, energy and moisture fluxes, drought, irrigation scheduling, and rainfall/runoff generation. Soil moisture and meteorological data are used to generate SVM predictions for four and seven days ahead. Predictions show good agreement with actual soil moisture measurements. Results from the SVM modeling are compared with predictions obtained from ANN models and show that SVM models performed better for soil moisture forecasting than ANN models.},

However, soil moisture involves complex structural characteristics and meteorological factors, and it is difficult to establish an ideal mathematical model for soil moisture prediction. Existing prediction models have problems such as prediction accuracy, generalization, and multi-feature processing capability, and prediction performance must improve. Based on this, taking the Beijing area as the research object, the deep learning regression network (DNNR) with big data fitting capability was proposed to construct a soil moisture prediction model. By integrating the dataset, analyzing the time series of the predictive variables, and clarifying the relationship between features and predictive variables through the Taylor diagram, selected meteorological parameters can provide effective weights for moisture prediction. Test results prove that the deep learning model is feasible and effective for soil moisture prediction. Its' good data fitting and generalization capability can enrich the input characteristics while ensuring high accuracy in predicting the trends and values of soil moisture data and provides an effective theoretical basis for water-saving irrigation and drought control.},

Therefore, it is important to predict the soil water content at different depths in maize root zone for rational agricultural irrigation. This study proposed a hybrid convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) integrated deep learning model that combines a CNN with strong feature expression capacity and a GRU neural network with strong memory capacity. The model was trained and tested with the soil water content and meteorological data from five representative sites in key maize producing areas, Shandong Province, China. We designed the model structure and selected the input variables based on a Pearson correlation analysis and soil water content autocorrelation analysis. The results showed that the hybrid CNN-GRU model performed better than the independent CNN or GRU model with respect to prediction accuracy and convergence rate. The average mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error and root mean squared error of the hybrid CNN-GRU model on day 3 were 0.91, 0.51 and 0.93, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the model improved with increasing soil depth. Extending the forecast period, the prediction accuracy values of the hybrid CNN-GRU model for the soil water content on days 5, 7 and 10 were comparable, with an average MSE of less than 1.0.},

Therefore, the numerical investigation of the soil\textendash water infiltration process provides the prerequisite for the determination of slope stability, which is of great significance for geological hazard prevention. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for a numerical investigation of soil\textendash water vertical infiltration with physics-informed neural networks and perform a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the soil\textendash water infiltration process in different soil types. In the proposed approach, the partial differential equation for soil\textendash water infiltration is combined with the neural network based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain numerical analysis of the soil\textendash water infiltration process. The results indicate that (1) compared with the traditional numerical method, the PINN-based method for the numerical investigation of soil\textendash water vertical infiltration proposed in this study has a smaller error and can obtain more accurate numerical results. (2) During vertical infiltration of water in the different soil types, the light loam is the fastest, the heavy-loam the second and the medium loam the slowest. medium-loam soils are less susceptible to water infiltration of the three soil types and are more suitable for the filling of artificial slopes and dams. The proposed approach could be employed for the simulation of soil\textendash water infiltration processes, not only for the discrimination of slope stability under rainfall conditions, but also for the selection of artificial slopes and dams to fill soil to prevent slope instability.},

  abstract   = {Core Ideas A community effort is needed to move soil modeling forward. Establishing an international soil modeling consortium is key in this respect. There is a need to better integrate existing knowledge in soil models. Integration of data and models is a key challenge in soil modeling. The remarkable complexity of soil and its importance to a wide range of ecosystem services presents major challenges to the modeling of soil processes. Although major progress in soil models has occurred in the last decades, models of soil processes remain disjointed between disciplines or ecosystem services, with considerable uncertainty remaining in the quality of predictions and several challenges that remain yet to be addressed. First, there is a need to improve exchange of knowledge and experience among the different disciplines in soil science and to reach out to other Earth science communities. Second, the community needs to develop a new generation of soil models based on a systemic approach comprising relevant physical, chemical, and biological processes to address critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of soil processes and their interactions. Overcoming these challenges will facilitate exchanges between soil modeling and climate, plant, and social science modeling communities. It will allow us to contribute to preserve and improve our assessment of ecosystem services and advance our understanding of climate-change feedback mechanisms, among others, thereby facilitating and strengthening communication among scientific disciplines and society. We review the role of modeling soil processes in quantifying key soil processes that shape ecosystem services, with a focus on provisioning and regulating services. We then identify key challenges in modeling soil processes, including the systematic incorporation of heterogeneity and uncertainty, the integration of data and models, and strategies for effective integration of knowledge on physical, chemical, and biological soil processes. We discuss how the soil modeling community could best interface with modern modeling activities in other disciplines, such as climate, ecology, and plant research, and how to weave novel observation and measurement techniques into soil models. We propose the establishment of an international soil modeling consortium to coherently advance soil modeling activities and foster communication with other Earth science disciplines. Such a consortium should promote soil modeling platforms and data repository for model development, calibration and intercomparison essential for addressing contemporary challenges.},

This problem can be seen as a learning task for which machine learning techniques have proven their relevance in many and diverse applications. In this paper we place ourselves in the context of potato farming, a crop for which irrigation plays a crucial role. We model the problem of soil water potential prediction as a learning problem solved by supervised leaning algorithms. The problem appears to be difficult since there are several potential inputs, and several outputs to predict. Experiments are conducted on several scenarios with data acquired during 3~years. We demonstrate the possibility of applying feature selection method to automatically design models with features relevant to the problem at hand while having good performances. We have also demonstrated the relevance of the machine learning for this kind of problem, since the methods are able to correctly predict the next water potential values.},

Here, we investigated a deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting the severity of language disorder from 3D lesion images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a heterogeneous sample of stroke patients. CNN performance was compared to that of conventional (shallow) machine learning methods, including ridge regression (RR) on the images' principal components and support vector regression. We also devised a hybrid method based on re-using CNN's high-level features as additional input to the RR model. Predictive accuracy of the four different methods was further investigated in relation to the size of the training set and the level of redundancy across lesion images in the dataset, which was evaluated in terms of location and topological properties of the lesions. The Hybrid model achieved the best performance in most cases, thereby suggesting that the high-level features extracted by CNNs are complementary to principal component analysis features and improve the model's predictive accuracy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that both the size of training data and image redundancy are critical factors in determining the accuracy of a computational model in predicting behavioral outcome from the structural brain imaging data of stroke patients.},

The vis-NIR spectroscopy research enthusiasm around the world has created regional to global soil spectral libraries. While machine learning methods have been utilised in processing spectral data, such large regional datasets are better dealt with big data analytics. Deep learning is an exciting discipline that has already transformed the way data are analysed in many fields and could also change the way we model soil spectral data. This study developed and evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, as a new way to predict soil properties from raw soil spectra. We demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs on the LUCAS soil database, which consists of around 20,000 topsoil observations with physicochemical and biological properties from Europe. To fully utilise the capacity of the CNN model, we represented the soil spectral data as a 2-dimensional spectrogram, showing the reflectance as a function of wavelength and frequency. We showed the capacity of a CNN to be trained in a multi-task setting to simultaneously predict six soil properties in one model (OC, CEC, clay, sand, pH, total N). Compared with conventional methods such as PLS regression and Cubist regression tree, the CNN performed significantly better, especially the multi-tasking model. In the case of soil organic carbon prediction, the multi-task CNN decreased the error by 87\% compared to PLS and 62\% compared with Cubist. This approach proved to be effective when trained on a relatively large dataset. The high accuracy of CNN makes it an ideal tool for modelling soil spectral data.},

Four machine learning algorithms, including classification and regression trees (CART), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Bayesian (BAYE), and random forests (RF), were implemented to downscale the monthly European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) SM product from 25-km to 1-km spatial resolution. During the regression, the land surface temperature (including daytime temperature, nighttime temperature, and diurnal fluctuation temperature), normalized difference vegetation index, surface reflections (red band, blue band, NIR band and MIR band), and digital elevation model were taken as explanatory variables to produce fine spatial resolution SM. We chose Northeast China as the study area and acquired corresponding SM data from 2003 to 2012 in unfrozen seasons. The reconstructed SM datasets were validated against in-situ measurements. The results showed that the RF-downscaled results had superior matching performance to both ESA CCI SM and in-situ measurements, and can positively respond to precipitation variation. Additionally, the RF was less affected by parameters, which revealed its robustness. Both CART and KNN ranked second. Compared to KNN, CART had a relatively close correlation with the validation data, but KNN showed preferable precision. Moreover, BAYE ranked last with significantly abnormal regression values.},

  abstract = {The skillful soil moisture (SM) for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L4 product can provide substantial value for many practical applications including ecosystem management and precision agriculture. Deep learning (DL) models provide powerful methods for hydrologic variables' prediction such as SM. However, the sample size of daily SM in the SMAP product is quite small, which may lead to overfitting and further impact the accuracy of DL models. From this, we first tested whether excellent predictive performance can be achieved with limited SMAP samples by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) models, which are frequent used for hydrologic prediction. Then we pre-trained the DL models in the source domain (ERA5-land) and fine-tuned them in the target domain (SMAP). The results show that the transfer ConvLSTM model had the highest R2 ranging from 0.909 to 0.916 and the lowest RMSE ranging from 0.0239 to 0.0247 for the lead time of 3, 5 and 7~days, and the regression lines between the predicted and the observed SM were closer to the ideal line (y~=~x) than all the other DL models. All the performances of transfer DL models were better than those of their corresponding DL models without transfer learning and some regions witnessed an increased explained variation over 20\%. The predictive ability of different factors (i.e., lagged SM, soil temperature, season, and precipitation) has been widely discussed in this paper. According the results, we advocate for applying cross-source transfer learning with DL models for SM prediction in newly built datasets.},

  abstract   = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last 10 years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Soil data and environmental data of tea plantations were transmitted to the server using sensor nodes and weather station nodes. The prediction models of soil moisture content and natural environmental parameters such as soil electrical conductivity, soil temperature, air temperature, air humidity, light intensity, and rainfall were developed using the SVM model optimised by the bald eagle search algorithm, and the mean square error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated to evaluate the model performance. Meanwhile, the performance of the BES-SVM model is compared with the particle swarm algorithm optimisation SVM (PSO-SVM) and genetic algorithm optimised SVM (GA-SVM) models. Results show that the proposed model has a mean coefficient of determination of 95.65\%, and the prediction performance is better than the PSO-SVM and GA-SVM model, indicating that the BES-SVM model has good performance and is a feasible prediction method for soil water content prediction and guiding irrigation and fertilisation management in tea plantations.},

There is need to create relation among these parameters to deduce soil water content as to limit cost of introducing sensors. The present investigation means to measure the progression of these four parameters in a green infrastructure site in an urban landscape and to additionally create correlations among them. An incorporated field testing and statistical modeling approach is embraced to accomplish the objective. Four sites including bare, grassed and treed soil are chosen for examination. Field monitoring was first directed to monitor the above mentioned four parameters for two months. This is trailed by statistical modeling using artificial intelligence (AI) approach (i.e., artificial neutral networks (ANN)). Correlations are created for evaluating soil water content as function of EC, RH and temperature for the four sites. Regardless of the sort of cover, EC is strongly correlated to soil water content, followed by RH and soil temperature. The correlation of EC is strongest in vegetated soil when compared with bare soil. The relationship of soil temperature with water content of soil do not have a decisive pattern. Ensuring drying of soils does not increase temperature fundamentally after precipitation. Uncertainty investigation additionally presumes that water content of soil follows normal distribution function in treed soils, while it follows skewed distribution in the cases of grassed and bare soils.},

  abstract   = {Soil water content is a key parameter for representing water dynamics in soils. Its prediction is fundamental for different practical applications, such as identifying shallow landslides triggering. Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning technique, which can be used to predict the temporal trend of a quantity since training from past data. SVM was applied to a test slope of Oltrep\`o Pavese (northern Italy), where meteorological parameters coupled with soil water content at different depths (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 m) were measured. Two SVM models were developed for water content assessment: (i) model 1, considering rainfall amount, air temperature, air humidity, net solar radiation, and wind speed; (ii) model 2, considering the same predictors of model 1 together with antecedent condition parameters (cumulated rainfall of 7, 30, and 60 days; mean air temperature of 7, 30, and 60 days). SVM model 2 showed significantly higher satisfactory results than model 1, for both training and test phases and for all the considered soil levels. SVM models trends were implemented in a methodology of slope safety factor assessment. For a real event occurred in the tested slope, the triggering time was correctly predicted using data estimated by SVM model based on antecedent meteorological conditions. This confirms the necessity of including these predictors for building a SVM technique able to estimate correctly soil moisture dynamics in time. The results of this paper show a promising potential application of the SVM methodologies for modeling soil moisture required in slope stability analysis.},

  abstract   = {Accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources. Soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle, which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological, ecological, and meteorological processes. The purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content. A hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model-grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and standalone ANFIS models. The models input parameters were di-electric constant, soil bulk density, clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples. Various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models. For a reliable ranking of models, the Global Performance Indicator (GPI) was utilized, which is a 5-agent index. The results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid ANFIS-GWO model with superior simulation results. At the testing stage, the MAE and SI values for the ANFIS-GWO were 1.468\% and 0.098, respectively, which indicated the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO compared to the ANFIS-Fuzzy C mean (MAE\,=\,6.427\%, SI\,=\,0.354), and ANFIS-sub clustering (MAE\,=\,2.137\%, SI\,=\,0.141) models. Based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model was ranked as the best model, followed by the standalone ANFIS and SVR models, while the worst accuracy was attained through ANN model. The ANFIS-GWO model improved the simulation accuracy by 48\% and 50\%, respectively, compared to the standalone ANFIS and SVR models. In addition, based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ANN model. The high accuracy of the ANFIS-GWO model compared to the standalone ANFIS model represents the performance of the GWO algorithm for escaping local optima, which makes the ANFIS-GWO as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture. Overall, the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo-sciences engineering principles.},

This paper applies decision tree regression to estimate SM considering different parameters including air temperature, time, relative humidity, and soil temperature. The presented method holds a mighty advantage to determine SM since the stimulant of the decision tree regression is an algorithm that generates a decision tree from given instances. Besides, usage of decision tree regression provides an opportunity to save time. Numerical results show that the presented method offers a high coefficient of determination value (R2), low mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The depth of the decision tree equals to five by providing higher fitness values than other depth levels. The best fitness values in the training stage are 0.00019, 0.007, and 0.842 for MSE, MAE, and~R2, respectively.

  abstract  = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Soil moisture is a key variable for drought monitoring, but soil moisture measurements networks are very scarce. Land-surface models can provide a valuable alternative for simulating soil moisture dynamics, but only a few countries have such modelling schemes implemented for monitoring soil moisture at high spatial resolution. In this study, a soil moisture accounting model (SMA) was regionalized over the Iberian Peninsula, taking as a reference the soil moisture simulated by a high-resolution land-surface model. To estimate the soil water holding capacity, the sole parameter required to run the SMA model, two approaches were compared: the direct estimation from European soil maps using pedotransfer functions or an indirect estimation by a machine learning approach, random forests, using as predictors altitude, temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and land use. Results showed that the random forest model estimates are more robust, especially for estimating low soil moisture levels. Consequently, the proposed approach can provide an efficient way to simulate daily soil moisture and therefore monitor soil moisture droughts, in contexts where high-resolution soil maps are not available, as it relies on a set of covariates that can be reliably estimated from global databases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
